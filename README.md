# IBM Data Science Professional Specialization Capstone Project

This Repo contains the Applied Data Science Capstone-Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification Specialization program designed and taught by IBM via Coursera. This Capsone-Project is the final course in a series of nine(9) Data Science Specialization courses which include the following courses:-

1. [What is Data Science?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience/home/welcome)
2. [Open Source tools for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science/home/welcome)
3. [Python for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science/home/welcome)
4. [Data Science Methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology/home/welcome)
5. [Databases and SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/home/welcome)
6. [Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization/home/welcome)
7. [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/home/welcome)
8. [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/home/welcome)
9. [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/welcome)

#### It is mandatory that all courses from 1 to 8 are passed with acceptable grades before attempting The Capsone-Project.**

##### Completing this Project earns the prestigious IBM Data Science badge. The badge earner is ready for a career in data science with demonstrated ability to solve for real-world problems. They can apply Data Science methodology - work with Jupyter notebooks - create Python apps - access relational databases using SQL & Python - use Python libraries to generate data visualizations - perform data analysis using Pandas - construct & evaluate Machine Learning (ML) models using Scikit-learn & SciPy and apply data science & ML techniques to real location data sets.

## Project Overview:

This capstone project course is a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. 

I will apply practical knowledge about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare and use this to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. I will also be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. 
I'd work with Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data. 

Finally, I will use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate my results and findings.

### Project Structure

1. <h4>Introduction:</h4>

In this module, you will learn about the scope of this capstone project and the context of the project that you will be working on. You will learn about different location data providers and what location data is normally composed of. Finally, you will be required to submit a link to a new repository on your Github account dedicated to this course.

2. <h4>Foursquare API</h4>:

In this module, you will learn in details about Foursquare, which is the location data provider we will be using in this course, and its API. Essentially, you will learn how to create a Foursquare developer account, and use your credentials to search for nearby venues of a specific type, explore a particular venue, and search for trending venues around a location.
